<h2>Describe how search engines work:</h2>
<p id="rcorners3">Search engines work by using what is known as “search engine robots” (also known as crawlers, spiders, or bots) to continuously crawl web pages to examine content information that will later be indexed. Indexing refers to the process of the search engine cataloging each webpage that was crawled and listing the URLs according to relevance about the site. Lastly, a unique search engine algorithm is applied to rank each page the bots have crawled. The results that appear are shown in order of what the search engine deems most relevant to least relevant, depending on several factors.

<h2>Explain the importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags:</h2>
<p id="rcorners3">Keywords and descriptions are important as meta tags because they help search engines weigh in on what is relevant to a user’s desired search results. Using specific keywords in a webpage’s title and throughout the page will help a search engine bot better sift through its index and more closely match a user’s query to what is on a webpage. Meta descriptions are the blurbs that appear under the link on a search engine’s results page, deeming this very valuable because it gives readers additional information about the relevance of that website for their needs.

<h2>List the four elements that comprise writing relevant content links:</h2>
<p id="rcorners3">The four elements that involve writing relevant content links are:<br><br>
  1.	Links should always be written with descriptive text<br><br>
  2.	Links should be written with concise text<br><br>
  3.	Links should be formatted so that they are easy to spot<br><br>
  4.	Whenever possible anchor text should be used for internal links

<h2>What constitutes good heading hierarchy and include an example with more than one heading tag:</h2>
<div class="test">Heading hierarchy is useful because it not only helps webpage visitors quickly scan websites for relevant content, but it also helps search engine optimization functioning. A good heading order consists of starting with the H1 tag. As with the following example, <h3>if there are subheadings use them in order </h3> <h4>from H2 through H6</h4><h5>being sure to use the smaller subheadings </h5> <h6>as you reduce content significance.</h6>
