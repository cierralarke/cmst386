        <h2>Explain the importance of responsive design and its impact on the target audience.</h2>
        <p id="rcorners3">Responsive web design is important because when a webpage automatically adjusts images and
          text to the user’s screen size it optimizes the user experience. Because there are dozens of options to view
          websites (i.e.: personal computers, mobile devices, tablets, Smart TVs, etc.), it is imperative that web
          design developers implement responsive design so that their content is resized properly to guarantee that
          viewers will revisit their sites.

        <h2>Describe three different kinds of reports that will tell you what information your target audience is
          accessing.</h2>
        <p id="rcorners3">1. Audience Reports - Active Users: This type of reporting shows how visitors interact with a
          website over the course of one day, one week, two weeks, or one month.
          <br><br>
          2. Behavior Reports – Behavior Flow Reports: This type of reporting is beneficial because it shows the path
          that visitors to a webpage clicked through since their initial access. Developers can use the information
          gained from this report to modify their webpages in a way that maximizes user experience. <br><br>
          3. Real-Time Reporting: With real-time reporting, developers are only seconds behind monitoring the activity
          on their site as it happens. Examining user interaction in this way helps designers understand why a
          particular feature on their webpage is flourishing or why the site needs to be updated to improve certain
          areas.
